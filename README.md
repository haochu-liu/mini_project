# Year 1 Mini Project
## Title
Modelling and inferring recombination in bacterial genomic evolution
## Supervisor
Professor Xavier Didelot and Dr Richard Everitt
## Background
Recombination happens frequently in most bacterial species. Traditional phylogenetic techniques do not account for this, which can greatly limit their usefulness for the analysis of genomic data. The coalescent with gene conversion accurately models the ancestry process of bacteria, and this can be used to simulate realistic data, but it is too complex to use in an inferential setting. Approximations have therefore been introduced, which are centred around the concept of the clonal genealogy, that is the phylogeny obtained by following the line of ancestry of the recipient of each recombination event. These mathematical models are the starting point of ongoing efforts to develop statistical methods and software to perform phylogenetic analysis in recombining bacteria, but current methods are either too simplistic or unable to scale to the large amounts of genomic data that are now available. 
## Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop, implement and test a new statistical methodology to perform joint statistical inference of a phylogenetic tree and recombination events.
## Proposed plan
1. Provide an overview of existing bacterial phylogenetic and recombination models.
2. Study a mathematical framework for bacterial phylogenetic models and implement a simulation algorithm.
3. Review current ABC algorithms and evaluate their applicability to bacterial phylogenetics.
4. Implement an approximation method to perform Bayesian inference.
5. Test the method and compare it to the original models using simulated data and real data.
